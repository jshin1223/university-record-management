## Project Description
The **University Record Management System** is a Python-based command-line application designed to manage university records, including:

- **Student Records**
- **Lecturer Records**
- **Course Records**
- **Department Records**
- **Research Projects**
- **Non-Academic Staff**

The system enables users to retrieve university records through a user-friendly menu-based interface.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
1. **Python 3.8 or higher** – Download and install from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **MySQL Server** – Install from the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
3. **MySQL Workbench** – Optional but recommended for executing SQL scripts and managing the database.

### Installing Dependencies
Once Python is installed, install the required dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution and Usage
### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

### Set Up the Database
Before running the application, ensure the database schema is created and populated with initial data:
1. **Run the database model script:**
   ```sh
   python models.py
   ```
2. **Execute the SQL data population script in MySQL Workbench** (see next section).

### Run the Application
Navigate to the project directory and run:
```sh
python ui.py
```

### Menu Options
When the application starts, you will see the following menu:
```
University Record Management System
1. Find students in a course
2. List courses in a department
3. List students with an average grade above 70%
4. Find staff in a department
5. Exit
Enter your choice:
```
Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.

## Executing SQL File in MySQL Workbench
To insert initial data into MySQL, follow these steps:
1. Open **MySQL Workbench** and connect to your MySQL Server.
2. Select the database `university_db` (or create it if it does not exist).
3. Click **File > Open SQL Script** and select `populate_data.sql`.
4. Click **Execute** to run the script.
5. Verify the data using:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM students;
   SELECT * FROM courses;
   ```

## Technologies Used
The project was built using:
- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **MySQL** (Relational Database Management System)
- **PyMySQL** (Python MySQL connector)
- **SQLAlchemy** (ORM for database models)

## Current Features
The University Record Management System supports:
- **Student Records:** Retrieve student details and enrollment information.
- **Lecturer Records:** View lecturer details and assigned courses.
- **Course Records:** List courses offered by departments.
- **Enrollment Management:** Ensure students are only enrolled in courses within their department.
- **Department Records:** Retrieve details about university departments.
- **Research Projects:** View research projects supervised by lecturers.
- **Non-Academic Staff Management:** Retrieve non-academic staff details.
